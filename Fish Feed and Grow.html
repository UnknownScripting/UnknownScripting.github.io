            <h1>Why Fish Feed and Grow is Good:</h1>
            <h4>Fish Feed and Grow is good because it’s not really addicting because there’s technically no goal. You just play to get
                coins and equip different fish. You might think: that does have a goal! It is addicting, but if you die with your fish
                you don’t have the fish anymore and you have to get it again, it’s kind of like Among Us. You also have to use 
                strategy like not going for the bigger fish and also not the bite the other fish’s mouth because then you’ll take damage
                too, bite the tail, so they’ll take damage but not you.</h4>
